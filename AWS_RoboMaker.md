# AAWS RoboMaker Reading and Resource List

AWS RoboMaker extends the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with cloud services and can be used to create robotics applications at scale. In this reading and resource list I provide a collection of curated open access resources on AWS RoboMaker. Curation of this list involved assessing 1 resources:  

* 1 resources were accepted.  
* 0 resources were rejected.  

The <> resources that were accepted were accurate, met inclusiveness expectations, did not require unrelated prior knowledge, and contained current information. If you think I missed a resource, or have any comments about this list or anything on it, please email me at b@straithe.com, submit a pull request, or raise a GitHub issue to let me know.
