# Reading And Resource Lists

The reading and resource lists in this repository are collections of curated open access resources on various topics. Each list covers one topic. I focus on open access resources for these lists so anyone can learn about the topics covered without having to traverse paywalls. Curation is an important aspect of these lists. I have assessed 43 resources:  

* 21 resources have been accepted.  
* 22 resources have been rejected.  

The 21 resources that have been accepted were accurate, met inclusiveness expectations, and contained current information. 

If you have suggestions for resource list topics, resources to add, or have any other comments about this repository or anything in it, please email me at b@straithe.com, submit a pull request, or raise a GitHub issue to let me know.
